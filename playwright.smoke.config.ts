/**
 * Root-level Playwright config for the narrow production smoke at
 * `tests/production-smoke.spec.ts`. Kept deliberately lean: no webServer, no
 * browser (the tests use `request` only), one worker.
 *
 * The richer browser-based smoke suite lives under `apps/web/` with its own
 * config — see `apps/web/playwright.smoke.config.ts`.
 *
 * Run:
 *   npx playwright test --config=playwright.smoke.config.ts
 *
 * Override target:
 *   PROD_API_URL=https://api-staging.instilligent.com \
 *     npx playwright test --config=playwright.smoke.config.ts
