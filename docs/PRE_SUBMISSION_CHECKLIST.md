## 7. Legal & Support Pages (DONE)

Privacy policy, terms of service, and support pages are now served directly from the API as server-rendered HTML pages. No separate website or hosting is needed for store submission.

| `https://api.instilligent.nz/legal/privacy` | Privacy policy | Both stores (mandatory) | Done |
| `https://api.instilligent.nz/legal/terms` | Terms of service | Both stores | Done |
| `https://api.instilligent.nz/legal/support` | Support page | Both stores | Done |

These URLs are already configured in `store-listing.json`. They will go live once the API is deployed to Railway at the `api.instilligent.nz` domain.

**Note**: A marketing/landing page is not required for store submission but can be added later at `instilligent.nz/trademate` or similar.

eas build --profile preview --platform ios

# 3. Distribute to testers via EAS
```

### Phase C: Production Submission
```bash
# After all placeholders replaced, screenshots ready, legal pages live:
