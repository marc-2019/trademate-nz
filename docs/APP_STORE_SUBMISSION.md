**Notes for Reviewers**:
```
TradeMate NZ is a business management app for New Zealand tradespeople
(plumbers, electricians, builders, etc.). It helps them manage health and
safety compliance documentation (SWMS - Safe Work Method Statements),
invoicing, quoting, expense tracking, and team management.

The app requires an account to use. A demo account has been provided above.

Camera access is used to photograph receipts, job sites, and safety
documentation. Photo library access is used to attach existing images
to invoices, expenses, and job logs.

The app is currently in free beta. No in-app purchases are active at
this time. Subscription features are planned for a future update.

The app does not use any third-party advertising or analytics SDKs.
Push notifications are used solely for certification expiry reminders.
```

### Step 6: Export Compliance

In App Store Connect:
- **Uses encryption**: No (we set `usesNonExemptEncryption: false` in app.json)
- This covers standard HTTPS/TLS which is exempt

### Step 7: iOS Privacy Manifest

The privacy manifest is already configured in `app.json` under `ios.privacyManifests`. It declares:
- **Accessed API types**: UserDefaults, FileTimestamp, SystemBootTime, DiskSpace (all required by React Native/Expo)
- **Collected data types**: Email, Name, Phone Number, Photos (all for app functionality, not tracking)
- **Tracking**: No

## Common Rejection Reasons

### Apple App Store

| Reason | How to Avoid |
|--------|-------------|
| **Incomplete information** | Fill in ALL App Store Connect fields including review notes and demo credentials |
| **Broken links** | Ensure support URL and privacy policy URL are live and accessible |
| **Placeholder content** | Remove all "Lorem ipsum", test data, and TODO markers from the app |
| **Missing purpose strings** | All permission usage descriptions must clearly explain why the app needs access (already configured in app.json) |
| **Guideline 4.2 - Minimum functionality** | Ensure the app provides genuine value. TradeMate has substantial functionality so this should not be an issue |
| **Guideline 5.1.1 - Data collection** | Privacy policy must match the data you actually collect. Ensure the privacy manifest in app.json is accurate |
| **Guideline 3.1.1 - In-App Purchase** | If subscription features are visible but not functional, clarify in review notes that they are "coming soon" and the app is in free beta |
| **Crashes or bugs** | Test thoroughly on physical devices before submission. Pay attention to edge cases like empty states, network errors, and permission denial flows |
| **Login required** | Provide demo credentials in App Review Information |
| **iPad layout** | If supporting iPad, ensure the layout works properly on larger screens |

### Google Play Store

| Reason | How to Avoid |
|--------|-------------|
| **Data safety form incomplete** | Fill in every section of the data safety questionnaire accurately |
| **Missing privacy policy** | Must be linked in both the store listing and within the app (settings screen) |
| **Target API level too low** | Expo SDK 54 targets API 35, which meets current requirements |
| **App access instructions missing** | Provide demo credentials since login is required |
| **Misleading store listing** | Ensure screenshots and description accurately represent the app |
| **Permissions not justified** | Each permission must be used and justified. Do not request unnecessary permissions |
| **Content rating missing** | Complete the IARC questionnaire before submitting |
| **Feature graphic missing** | 1024x500 px graphic is mandatory |

---
